# Socialise
Msc in Web Technologies - Mobile Applications Development (UI111012) - Project App

Socialise - A student hangout app, built using Ionic and Vuejs.  Written in Typescript/Javascript.  Firebase on the backend for authentication and data persistence.

This is a project build for my Masters course in Web Technologies with the University of Highlands & Islands.  The brief was to build a "student hangout" style app that offers a social media style service, where users are able to post messages and replies.  To be designed to promote inter-departmental interactions.  Additional features could include user authentication, notifications and the ability to upload images.  This is still massively a work in progress.
